You are a VRL performance optimization expert. Analyze these {{ device_type or 'log' }} samples and propose {{ candidate_count }} substantially different VRL parsing approaches.

{% if baseline_vrl %}
üèÜ WORKING BASELINE VRL (Use as reference for optimization):
```vrl
{{ baseline_vrl }}
```

This baseline VRL WORKS and passes validation. Create performance variations that:
1. MAINTAIN the field extraction functionality
2. OPTIMIZE the approach for better VPI performance
3. BUILD ON the proven patterns above
{% endif %}

Each strategy should have a FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT approach to parsing, such as:
1. Ultra-fast string operations (optimize baseline by removing complex logic)
2. Structured parsing with built-in functions (parse_syslog, parse_json)
3. Pattern detection with conditional logic (simplify baseline conditionals)
4. Field extraction with minimal processing (extract fewer fields faster)
5. Security-focused with threat detection (add security field prioritization)
6. Performance-optimized with early exits (add more early exits to baseline)
7. Comprehensive parsing with all possible fields (extend baseline fields)
8. Minimalist approach (reduce baseline to essential fields only)

SAMPLE DATA:
```
{{ sample_logs[:3000] }}
```

{% if baseline_vrl %}
REQUIREMENT: Each strategy must extract AT LEAST the same core fields as the baseline.
{% endif %}

For each strategy, provide:
- **name**: Short identifier (e.g., "optimized_baseline")
- **description**: What makes this approach unique vs baseline
- **approach**: Key technical differences and optimizations
- **vpi_target**: Expected VPI performance tier vs baseline

Return ONLY a JSON array of {{ candidate_count }} strategies:
[
  {"name": "strategy1", "description": "...", "approach": "...", "vpi_target": "high"},
  {"name": "strategy2", "description": "...", "approach": "...", "vpi_target": "moderate"},
  ...
]

You are a VRL performance optimization expert. Analyze these {{ device_type or 'log' }} samples and propose {{ candidate_count }} substantially different VRL parsing approaches.

Each strategy should have a FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT approach to parsing, such as:
1. Ultra-fast string operations only (no built-in parsers)
2. Structured parsing with built-in functions (parse_syslog, parse_json)
3. Pattern detection with conditional logic
4. Field extraction with minimal processing
5. Security-focused with threat detection
6. Performance-optimized with early exits
7. Comprehensive parsing with all possible fields
8. Minimalist approach (only essential fields)
9. Event classification focused
10. Time-series optimized

SAMPLE DATA:
```
{{ sample_logs[:5000] }}
```

For each strategy, provide:
- **name**: Short identifier (e.g., "ultra_string_ops")
- **description**: What makes this approach unique
- **approach**: Key technical differences from other strategies
- **vpi_target**: Expected VPI performance tier

Return ONLY a JSON array of {{ candidate_count }} strategies:
[
  {"name": "strategy1", "description": "...", "approach": "...", "vpi_target": "high"},
  {"name": "strategy2", "description": "...", "approach": "...", "vpi_target": "moderate"},
  ...
